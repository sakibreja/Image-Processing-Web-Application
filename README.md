# Image-Processing-Web-Application
Role: Computer Vision Developer & Full Stack Engineer
Purpose: Designed and deployed a web application to perform real-time image processing tasks, allowing users to visualize grayscale transformations of uploaded images using OpenCV and Streamlit.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Key Contributions:
•	Built a Streamlit-based interface for seamless image upload and real-time visualization.
•	Implemented image processing pipelines using OpenCV for grayscale conversion and NumPy for array manipulation.
•	Integrated PIL and OpenCV to handle image format transformations and display results dynamically.
•	Ensured cross-compatibility between image formats (JPG, PNG, JPEG) for broad user accessibility.
Impact: Delivered an intuitive platform for users to experiment with foundational computer vision techniques, serving as a scalable template for advanced image analysis applications in fields like medical imaging, photography, and AI training.
